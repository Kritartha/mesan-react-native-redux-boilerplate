# React Native Redux Boilerplate
React Native Redux Quotes App with CRUD operations

In the <a href="http://mosesesan.com/blog/2017/06/18/react-native-redux-boilerplate/">previous</a> tutorial, we created a basic React Native app that uses Redux to display information stored in the Redux store, our data was stored in a json file that was accessed every time the <strong>getData</strong> function is called. For this tutorial, I will be transforming the app to a Quotes app, that allows the user to <strong>add</strong>, <strong>view</strong>, <strong>update</strong> and <strong>delete</strong> quotes, in order to achieve this, I will be adding CRUD operations.
